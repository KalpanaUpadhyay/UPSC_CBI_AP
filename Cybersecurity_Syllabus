**Basic Terminology**     
🧠 Core Concepts
1. Threat
A potential cause of an unwanted incident that may result in harm to a system or organization.

🔸 It’s the "what could go wrong."

🔐 Examples:

A hacker trying to access sensitive data.

Natural disasters like floods affecting a data center.

Insider trying to leak confidential files.

2. Vulnerability
A weakness or flaw in a system that can be exploited by a threat.

🔸 It’s the "loophole or gap" in your defense.

🔐 Examples:

Unpatched software

Weak passwords

Open ports with no firewall

3. Risk
The likelihood that a threat will exploit a vulnerability and cause harm.

🔸 Risk = Threat × Vulnerability × Impact

🔐 Example:

If a server has an outdated OS (vulnerability) and hackers are scanning the internet (threat), then there’s a high risk of an attack.

4. Exploit
A tool, script, or technique used to take advantage of a vulnerability.

🔸 It’s the "weapon" used in an attack.

🔐 Examples:

SQL injection script

Buffer overflow code

Malware exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities

5. Attack Vector
The path or means by which a threat actor gains access to a system.

🔸 It’s the "entry door" into the system.

🔐 Examples:

Phishing email (email is the vector)

Malicious USB drive

A fake login page (web interface vector)

🧪 Real-Life Example
Imagine your system has weak login passwords.

🔸 Threat = A hacker wants to break in.

🔸 Vulnerability = Weak password.

🔸 Exploit = Brute-force tool used to guess the password.

🔸 Attack Vector = Login page on the website.

🔸 Risk = High, because the system can be compromised easily.
