**Basic Terminology**     
🧠 Core Concepts
1. Threat
A potential cause of an unwanted incident that may result in harm to a system or organization.

🔸 It’s the "what could go wrong."

🔐 Examples:

A hacker trying to access sensitive data.

Natural disasters like floods affecting a data center.

Insider trying to leak confidential files.

2. Vulnerability
A weakness or flaw in a system that can be exploited by a threat.

🔸 It’s the "loophole or gap" in your defense.

🔐 Examples:

Unpatched software

Weak passwords

Open ports with no firewall

3. Risk
The likelihood that a threat will exploit a vulnerability and cause harm.

🔸 Risk = Threat × Vulnerability × Impact

🔐 Example:

If a server has an outdated OS (vulnerability) and hackers are scanning the internet (threat), then there’s a high risk of an attack.

4. Exploit
A tool, script, or technique used to take advantage of a vulnerability.

🔸 It’s the "weapon" used in an attack.

🔐 Examples:

SQL injection script

Buffer overflow code

Malware exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities

5. Attack Vector
The path or means by which a threat actor gains access to a system.

🔸 It’s the "entry door" into the system.

🔐 Examples:

Phishing email (email is the vector)

Malicious USB drive

A fake login page (web interface vector)

🧪 Real-Life Example
Imagine your system has weak login passwords.

🔸 Threat = A hacker wants to break in.

🔸 Vulnerability = Weak password.

🔸 Exploit = Brute-force tool used to guess the password.

🔸 Attack Vector = Login page on the website.

🔸 Risk = High, because the system can be compromised easily.

**Encryption & Cryptography**

🔐 What is Cryptography?
Cryptography is the practice of securing data by converting it into an unreadable format (encryption) that can only be made readable again (decryption) with a secret key.

🧱 Types of Cryptography
Type	Description	Examples
Symmetric Encryption	Same key is used for encryption and decryption. Fast, but less secure if key is shared.	AES, DES
Asymmetric Encryption	Uses a public key to encrypt and a private key to decrypt. More secure, but slower.	RSA, ECC
Hashing	Converts data into a fixed-length string. One-way only (no decryption). Used for password storage, integrity.	SHA, MD5

🔐 Symmetric Encryption
Key Point: One shared key for both sender & receiver.

Example:
If Kalpana sends a message to a server, both use the same secret key to encrypt and decrypt it.

Common Algorithms: AES, DES

🔸 AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is widely used and very secure.

🔐 Asymmetric Encryption
Key Point: Uses two keys — public and private.

Public Key: Known to everyone

Private Key: Kept secret by the owner

Example:
You encrypt a message using someone's public key — only they can decrypt it using their private key.

🔸 RSA is the most widely used asymmetric algorithm.

🔐 Hashing
Key Point: Irreversible function; mainly for verifying data integrity.

Converts input into a fixed-size hash.

Used for storing passwords, verifying file integrity.

Popular Hash Functions: MD5 (outdated), SHA-1, SHA-256

🔁 Summary Table
Feature	Symmetric	Asymmetric	Hashing
Key Type	One key	Public & Private	No key
Speed	Fast	Slow	Fast
Use Case	Bulk data encryption	Secure key exchange	Data integrity (e.g., passwords)
Reversible	Yes	Yes	No

🧠 Sample Questions
Which of the following is an asymmetric encryption algorithm?
a) DES
b) AES
c) RSA
d) SHA-1
➤ Answer: c) RSA

Hashing is primarily used for:
a) Encrypting emails
b) Key exchange
c) Data integrity verification
d) Compressing files
➤ Answer: c) Data integrity verification

What’s the key difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption?
➤ Symmetric uses one shared key, asymmetric uses a key pair (public + private).



**Network Security**       

🔐 1. Firewalls
🔸 What is it?
A firewall is a security system (hardware or software) that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined rules.

🔸 Key Points:
Acts as a barrier between trusted (internal) and untrusted (external) networks.

Filters traffic based on IP, port, protocol.

Can block unauthorized access.

🔥 Types:
Packet-filtering Firewall (checks IPs and ports)

Stateful Firewall (tracks active connections)

Application-layer Firewall (e.g., proxy firewalls)

🧠 Example:
A firewall blocks port 21 to prevent FTP traffic from untrusted sources.

🕵️‍♀️ 2. IDS / IPS
🔸 IDS (Intrusion Detection System)
A tool that monitors network traffic and raises alerts when suspicious activity is detected.

Passive – detects and alerts only.

Example: Snort, OSSEC

🔸 IPS (Intrusion Prevention System)
Like IDS, but actively blocks or stops malicious activity.

Active – detects + takes action (drops packet, resets connection).

✅ IDS vs IPS:
Feature	IDS	IPS
Role	Detect	Detect + Prevent
Placement	After firewall	Inline (real-time)
Response	Alerts only	Blocks traffic

🌐 3. VPN (Virtual Private Network)
🔸 What is it?
A VPN encrypts your internet traffic and routes it through a remote server, creating a secure "tunnel".

🔸 Use Cases:
Secure remote access

Bypassing geo-restrictions

Protect data on public Wi-Fi

🔐 Protocols Used:
PPTP, L2TP, OpenVPN, IPsec

Example: Bank employees use VPN to securely connect to internal systems from home.

🧭 4. Proxy Server
🔸 What is it?
A proxy server acts as an intermediary between the user and the internet.

🔸 Functions:
Hide IP address (anonymity)

Content filtering

Cache websites for faster access

Often used in schools/offices to control access

Example: A proxy can block access to social media websites in a corporate environment.

🔁 Summary Table
Tool	Function	Passive/Active	Example
Firewall	Blocks or allows traffic	Active	iptables, UFW
IDS	Detects suspicious activity	Passive	Snort
IPS	Detects + blocks activity	Active	Suricata
VPN	Encrypts traffic for secure remote access	Active	OpenVPN
Proxy	Intermediary, filters content	Passive/Active	Squid Proxy

🧠 Sample MCQs

➤ Answer: Proxy Server



 **Authentication & Authorization** 
🔐 2FA, OAuth, Biometrics, Tokens – Explained
These terms are all related to user identification and access control:

✅ 1. 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication)
A security process in which two different types of credentials are required to verify a user’s identity.

🧱 Example:
You enter your password (something you know)

You get an OTP on mobile (something you have)

✅ Adds an extra layer of security beyond just a password.

🔐 Types of Factors:
Factor Type	Example
Something you know	Password, PIN
Something you have	OTP, Smart card
Something you are	Fingerprint, Face ID

✅ 2. OAuth (Open Authorization)
A token-based authorization framework that lets third-party apps access your data without sharing your password.

🧱 Example:
You click "Login with Google" on a third-party website.

That site uses OAuth to request limited access to your Google account (like email).

✅ You don’t give your password to the third party.
✅ Scopes restrict what the app can do (read-only, read-write, etc.).

✅ 3. Biometrics
Uses unique biological traits for identification or access.

🔐 Common Biometrics:
Fingerprint

Face recognition

Iris scan

Voice recognition

✅ Pros:
Hard to fake

Convenient

❌ Cons:
Privacy concerns

Can’t be changed if leaked (unlike passwords)

✅ 4. Tokens
A randomly generated string used to authenticate or authorize a user/session.

🧱 Types of Tokens:
Token Type	Usage Example
Session Token	After login, used in cookies
API Token	Used for REST API access
Access Token (OAuth)	Grants access to user data
Hardware Token	Physical device generating OTPs

Example: A token sent to your email after login to verify your identity.

🔁 Summary Table
Term	Category	Purpose	Example
2FA	Authentication	Identity verification	OTP + Password
OAuth	Authorization	Allow app to access your account	Login with Facebook
Biometrics	Authentication	Physical identity check	Fingerprint scanner
Tokens	Authentication/Authorization	Provide access/session	Bearer token, OTP

🧠 Sample MCQs
Which of the following is a two-factor authentication method?
