**Basic Terminology**     
🧠 Core Concepts
1. Threat
A potential cause of an unwanted incident that may result in harm to a system or organization.

🔸 It’s the "what could go wrong."

🔐 Examples:

A hacker trying to access sensitive data.

Natural disasters like floods affecting a data center.

Insider trying to leak confidential files.

2. Vulnerability
A weakness or flaw in a system that can be exploited by a threat.

🔸 It’s the "loophole or gap" in your defense.

🔐 Examples:

Unpatched software

Weak passwords

Open ports with no firewall

3. Risk
The likelihood that a threat will exploit a vulnerability and cause harm.

🔸 Risk = Threat × Vulnerability × Impact

🔐 Example:

If a server has an outdated OS (vulnerability) and hackers are scanning the internet (threat), then there’s a high risk of an attack.

4. Exploit
A tool, script, or technique used to take advantage of a vulnerability.

🔸 It’s the "weapon" used in an attack.

🔐 Examples:

SQL injection script

Buffer overflow code

Malware exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities

5. Attack Vector
The path or means by which a threat actor gains access to a system.

🔸 It’s the "entry door" into the system.

🔐 Examples:

Phishing email (email is the vector)

Malicious USB drive

A fake login page (web interface vector)

🧪 Real-Life Example
Imagine your system has weak login passwords.

🔸 Threat = A hacker wants to break in.

🔸 Vulnerability = Weak password.

🔸 Exploit = Brute-force tool used to guess the password.

🔸 Attack Vector = Login page on the website.

🔸 Risk = High, because the system can be compromised easily.

**Encryption & Cryptography**

🔐 What is Cryptography?
Cryptography is the practice of securing data by converting it into an unreadable format (encryption) that can only be made readable again (decryption) with a secret key.

🧱 Types of Cryptography
Type	Description	Examples
Symmetric Encryption	Same key is used for encryption and decryption. Fast, but less secure if key is shared.	AES, DES
Asymmetric Encryption	Uses a public key to encrypt and a private key to decrypt. More secure, but slower.	RSA, ECC
Hashing	Converts data into a fixed-length string. One-way only (no decryption). Used for password storage, integrity.	SHA, MD5

🔐 Symmetric Encryption
Key Point: One shared key for both sender & receiver.

Example:
If Kalpana sends a message to a server, both use the same secret key to encrypt and decrypt it.

Common Algorithms: AES, DES

🔸 AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is widely used and very secure.

🔐 Asymmetric Encryption
Key Point: Uses two keys — public and private.

Public Key: Known to everyone

Private Key: Kept secret by the owner

Example:
You encrypt a message using someone's public key — only they can decrypt it using their private key.

🔸 RSA is the most widely used asymmetric algorithm.

🔐 Hashing
Key Point: Irreversible function; mainly for verifying data integrity.

Converts input into a fixed-size hash.

Used for storing passwords, verifying file integrity.

Popular Hash Functions: MD5 (outdated), SHA-1, SHA-256

🔁 Summary Table
Feature	Symmetric	Asymmetric	Hashing
Key Type	One key	Public & Private	No key
Speed	Fast	Slow	Fast
Use Case	Bulk data encryption	Secure key exchange	Data integrity (e.g., passwords)
Reversible	Yes	Yes	No

🧠 Sample Questions
Which of the following is an asymmetric encryption algorithm?
a) DES
b) AES
c) RSA
d) SHA-1
➤ Answer: c) RSA

Hashing is primarily used for:
a) Encrypting emails
b) Key exchange
c) Data integrity verification
d) Compressing files
➤ Answer: c) Data integrity verification

What’s the key difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption?
➤ Symmetric uses one shared key, asymmetric uses a key pair (public + private).



**Network Security**       

🔐 1. Firewalls
🔸 What is it?
A firewall is a security system (hardware or software) that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined rules.

🔸 Key Points:
Acts as a barrier between trusted (internal) and untrusted (external) networks.

Filters traffic based on IP, port, protocol.

Can block unauthorized access.

🔥 Types:
Packet-filtering Firewall (checks IPs and ports)

Stateful Firewall (tracks active connections)

Application-layer Firewall (e.g., proxy firewalls)

🧠 Example:
A firewall blocks port 21 to prevent FTP traffic from untrusted sources.

🕵️‍♀️ 2. IDS / IPS
🔸 IDS (Intrusion Detection System)
A tool that monitors network traffic and raises alerts when suspicious activity is detected.

Passive – detects and alerts only.

Example: Snort, OSSEC

🔸 IPS (Intrusion Prevention System)
Like IDS, but actively blocks or stops malicious activity.

Active – detects + takes action (drops packet, resets connection).

✅ IDS vs IPS:
Feature	IDS	IPS
Role	Detect	Detect + Prevent
Placement	After firewall	Inline (real-time)
Response	Alerts only	Blocks traffic

🌐 3. VPN (Virtual Private Network)
🔸 What is it?
A VPN encrypts your internet traffic and routes it through a remote server, creating a secure "tunnel".

🔸 Use Cases:
Secure remote access

Bypassing geo-restrictions

Protect data on public Wi-Fi

🔐 Protocols Used:
PPTP, L2TP, OpenVPN, IPsec

Example: Bank employees use VPN to securely connect to internal systems from home.

🧭 4. Proxy Server
🔸 What is it?
A proxy server acts as an intermediary between the user and the internet.

🔸 Functions:
Hide IP address (anonymity)

Content filtering

Cache websites for faster access

Often used in schools/offices to control access

Example: A proxy can block access to social media websites in a corporate environment.

 **Authentication & Authorization** 
🔐 2FA, OAuth, Biometrics, Tokens – Explained
These terms are all related to user identification and access control:

✅ 1. 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication)
A security process in which two different types of credentials are required to verify a user’s identity.

🧱 Example:
You enter your password (something you know)

You get an OTP on mobile (something you have)

✅ Adds an extra layer of security beyond just a password.

🔐 Types of Factors:
Factor Type	Example
Something you know	Password, PIN
Something you have	OTP, Smart card
Something you are	Fingerprint, Face ID

✅ 2. OAuth (Open Authorization)
A token-based authorization framework that lets third-party apps access your data without sharing your password.

🧱 Example:
You click "Login with Google" on a third-party website.

That site uses OAuth to request limited access to your Google account (like email).

✅ You don’t give your password to the third party.
✅ Scopes restrict what the app can do (read-only, read-write, etc.).

✅ 3. Biometrics
Uses unique biological traits for identification or access.

🔐 Common Biometrics:
Fingerprint

Face recognition

Iris scan

Voice recognition

✅ Pros:
Hard to fake

Convenient

❌ Cons:

These protections help safeguard:

Sensitive user data (passwords, credit card info)

Website functionality (login, search, forms)

Backend systems (database, APIs)

🛡️ Key Threats in Web Security
Let’s break down the most common web-based vulnerabilities and how to prevent them:

1. SQL Injection (SQLi)
Injecting malicious SQL queries into input fields to manipulate a database.

🧠 Example:

Input: ' OR 1=1 --
➤ This bypasses login verification.

✅ Protection:

Use prepared statements (parameterized queries)

Input validation and sanitization

2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Attacker injects malicious JavaScript into a webpage to run in users' browsers.

🧠 Example:

html
Copy
Edit
<script>alert('hacked')</script>
✅ Protection:

Escape user input before rendering on page

Use Content Security Policy (CSP)

3. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
Forces a logged-in user to unknowingly send malicious requests (e.g., bank transfer).

🧠 Example:
Attacker sends a link like:

arduino
Copy
Edit
http://bank.com/transfer?amount=50000&to=attacker
When clicked by a logged-in user, it executes.

✅ Protection:

Use CSRF tokens

Validate origin headers

4. Broken Authentication
Poor session management or predictable login flows allow attackers to hijack user sessions.

✅ Protection:

Implement multi-factor authentication (2FA)

Use secure, time-bound session tokens

Use HTTPS

5. Security Misconfiguration
Incorrect settings in servers, databases, or apps can expose sensitive data.

🧠 Example:

Default admin passwords
