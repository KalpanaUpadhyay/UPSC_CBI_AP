**Basic Terminology**     
🧠 Core Concepts
1. Threat
A potential cause of an unwanted incident that may result in harm to a system or organization.

🔸 It’s the "what could go wrong."

🔐 Examples:

A hacker trying to access sensitive data.

Natural disasters like floods affecting a data center.

Insider trying to leak confidential files.

2. Vulnerability
A weakness or flaw in a system that can be exploited by a threat.

🔸 It’s the "loophole or gap" in your defense.

🔐 Examples:

Unpatched software

Weak passwords

Open ports with no firewall

3. Risk
The likelihood that a threat will exploit a vulnerability and cause harm.

🔸 Risk = Threat × Vulnerability × Impact

🔐 Example:

If a server has an outdated OS (vulnerability) and hackers are scanning the internet (threat), then there’s a high risk of an attack.

4. Exploit
A tool, script, or technique used to take advantage of a vulnerability.

🔸 It’s the "weapon" used in an attack.

🔐 Examples:

SQL injection script

Buffer overflow code

Malware exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities

5. Attack Vector
The path or means by which a threat actor gains access to a system.

🔸 It’s the "entry door" into the system.

🔐 Examples:

Phishing email (email is the vector)

Malicious USB drive

A fake login page (web interface vector)

🧪 Real-Life Example
Imagine your system has weak login passwords.

🔸 Threat = A hacker wants to break in.

🔸 Vulnerability = Weak password.

🔸 Exploit = Brute-force tool used to guess the password.

🔸 Attack Vector = Login page on the website.

🔸 Risk = High, because the system can be compromised easily.

📌 Quick MCQ Practice

Which of the following refers to the combination of a threat exploiting a vulnerability?
➤ Answer: Risk


**Encryption & Cryptography**

🔐 What is Cryptography?
Cryptography is the practice of securing data by converting it into an unreadable format (encryption) that can only be made readable again (decryption) with a secret key.

🧱 Types of Cryptography
Type	Description	Examples
Symmetric Encryption	Same key is used for encryption and decryption. Fast, but less secure if key is shared.	AES, DES
Asymmetric Encryption	Uses a public key to encrypt and a private key to decrypt. More secure, but slower.	RSA, ECC
Hashing	Converts data into a fixed-length string. One-way only (no decryption). Used for password storage, integrity.	SHA, MD5

🔐 Symmetric Encryption
Key Point: One shared key for both sender & receiver.

Example:
If Kalpana sends a message to a server, both use the same secret key to encrypt and decrypt it.

Common Algorithms: AES, DES

🔸 AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is widely used and very secure.

🔐 Asymmetric Encryption
Key Point: Uses two keys — public and private.

Public Key: Known to everyone

Private Key: Kept secret by the owner

Example:
You encrypt a message using someone's public key — only they can decrypt it using their private key.

🔸 RSA is the most widely used asymmetric algorithm.

🔐 Hashing
Key Point: Irreversible function; mainly for verifying data integrity.

Converts input into a fixed-size hash.

Used for storing passwords, verifying file integrity.

Popular Hash Functions: MD5 (outdated), SHA-1, SHA-256

🔁 Summary Table
Feature	Symmetric	Asymmetric	Hashing
Key Type	One key	Public & Private	No key
Speed	Fast	Slow	Fast
Use Case	Bulk data encryption	Secure key exchange	Data integrity (e.g., passwords)
Reversible	Yes	Yes	No

🧠 Sample Questions
Which of the following is an asymmetric encryption algorithm?
a) DES
b) AES
c) RSA
d) SHA-1
➤ Answer: c) RSA

Hashing is primarily used for:
a) Encrypting emails
b) Key exchange
c) Data integrity verification
d) Compressing files
➤ Answer: c) Data integrity verification

What’s the key difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption?
➤ Symmetric uses one shared key, asymmetric uses a key pair (public + private).



**Network Security**       

🔐 1. Firewalls
🔸 What is it?
A firewall is a security system (hardware or software) that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined rules.

🔸 Key Points:
Acts as a barrier between trusted (internal) and untrusted (external) networks.

Filters traffic based on IP, port, protocol.

Can block unauthorized access.

🔥 Types:
Packet-filtering Firewall (checks IPs and ports)

Stateful Firewall (tracks active connections)

Application-layer Firewall (e.g., proxy firewalls)

🧠 Example:
A firewall blocks port 21 to prevent FTP traffic from untrusted sources.

🕵️‍♀️ 2. IDS / IPS
🔸 IDS (Intrusion Detection System)
A tool that monitors network traffic and raises alerts when suspicious activity is detected.

Passive – detects and alerts only.

Example: Snort, OSSEC

🔸 IPS (Intrusion Prevention System)
Like IDS, but actively blocks or stops malicious activity.

Active – detects + takes action (drops packet, resets connection).

✅ IDS vs IPS:
Feature	IDS	IPS
Role	Detect	Detect + Prevent
Placement	After firewall	Inline (real-time)
Response	Alerts only	Blocks traffic

🌐 3. VPN (Virtual Private Network)
🔸 What is it?
A VPN encrypts your internet traffic and routes it through a remote server, creating a secure "tunnel".

🔸 Use Cases:
Secure remote access

Bypassing geo-restrictions

Protect data on public Wi-Fi

🔐 Protocols Used:
PPTP, L2TP, OpenVPN, IPsec

Example: Bank employees use VPN to securely connect to internal systems from home.

🧭 4. Proxy Server
🔸 What is it?
A proxy server acts as an intermediary between the user and the internet.

🔸 Functions:
Hide IP address (anonymity)

Content filtering

Cache websites for faster access

Often used in schools/offices to control access

Example: A proxy can block access to social media websites in a corporate environment.

🔁 Summary Table
Tool	Function	Passive/Active	Example
Firewall	Blocks or allows traffic	Active	iptables, UFW
IDS	Detects suspicious activity	Passive	Snort
IPS	Detects + blocks activity	Active	Suricata
VPN	Encrypts traffic for secure remote access	Active	OpenVPN
Proxy	Intermediary, filters content	Passive/Active	Squid Proxy

🧠 Sample MCQs
Which tool only detects intrusions but does not block them?
➤ Answer: IDS

What is the primary role of a firewall?
a) Encrypt data
b) Prevent malware
c) Filter network traffic
d) Store data
➤ Answer: c) Filter network traffic

A VPN primarily provides:
➤ Answer: Secure remote access

Which tool can help anonymize your internet activity?
➤ Answer: Proxy Server
