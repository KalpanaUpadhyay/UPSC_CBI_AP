☁️ What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing is delivering computing services (like servers, storage, databases, networking, software) over the internet ("the cloud") to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.

☁️ 1. Characteristics of Cloud Computing
Feature	Description
On-demand self-service	Users can access resources as needed
Broad network access	Available over the internet via multiple devices
Resource pooling	Shared infrastructure across multiple users
Rapid elasticity	Scale up/down resources instantly
Measured service	Pay-per-use (metered billing)

✅ MCQ Tip: These 5 are the NIST characteristics often asked in exams.

☁️ 2. Cloud Service Models
🔹 a. IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)
Provides virtualized hardware resources over the internet.

🧠 Example: Amazon EC2, Microsoft Azure VM

You manage: OS, apps, middleware.
Provider manages: servers, storage, networking.

🔹 b. PaaS (Platform as a Service)
Provides a platform to develop, run, and manage apps.

🧠 Example: Google App Engine, Heroku

You manage: Applications.
Provider manages: OS, runtime, hardware.

🔹 c. SaaS (Software as a Service)
Provides fully functional software over the internet.

🧠 Example: Google Workspace, Salesforce, Office 365

You just use it — no setup or infrastructure.

✅ MCQ Tip:

Gmail? ➝ SaaS

AWS EC2? ➝ IaaS

App development platform? ➝ PaaS

☁️ 3. Cloud Deployment Models
| Model               | Description                             | Example                                |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Public Cloud**    | Owned by cloud provider, used by public | AWS, Azure                             |
| **Private Cloud**   | Used by one organization only           | Government/private bank cloud          |
| **Hybrid Cloud**    | Mix of public + private                 | Sensitive data on private, rest public |
| **Community Cloud** | Shared by similar orgs                  | Shared hospital cloud                  |

☁️ 4. Virtualization in Cloud
Virtualization enables multiple virtual machines to run on a single physical machine.

🧠 Uses:

Better hardware utilization

Isolated environments

Key enabler of cloud infrastructure

✅ Hypervisors:

Type 1: Bare metal (VMware ESXi, Hyper-V)

Type 2: Hosted on OS (VirtualBox)

☁️ 5. Benefits of Cloud Computing
Cost-effective (no hardware purchase)

Scalable & flexible

Easy backup & recovery

Better collaboration

Automatic updates

🔒 6. Cloud Security Concepts
| Term                 | Description                                   |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Data encryption**  | Protects data at rest & in transit            |
| **IAM**              | Identity & Access Management                  |
| **Multi-tenancy**    | Multiple customers share same infra securely  |
| **DDoS Protection**  | Mitigates denial-of-service attacks           |
| **Cloud Compliance** | Following standards like GDPR, ISO, RBI norms |
