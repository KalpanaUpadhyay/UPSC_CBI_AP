ðŸ”¹ Notes for Today
1. What is .NET Framework?
A software framework developed by Microsoft.

Used to build and run Windows applications.

Supports multiple languages (C#, VB.NET, F#).

2. Key Components:
| Component                     | Description                                               |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| CLR (Common Language Runtime) | Executes .NET programs, handles memory, exceptions        |
| BCL (Base Class Library)      | Provides core functionality (file I/O, collections, etc.) |
| FCL (Framework Class Library) | Set of reusable classes for development                   |
| ASP.NET                       | Framework to build web apps                               |
| ADO.NET                       | Used for database connectivity                            |

3. Common Language Runtime (CLR)
Manages memory, type safety, and garbage collection.

Converts Intermediate Language (IL) â†’ Native Code via JIT Compiler.

4. Managed vs Unmanaged Code
Managed Code: Runs under the control of CLR (e.g., C#).

Unmanaged Code: Runs outside the CLR (e.g., C/C++ compiled code).
